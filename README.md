## SDK Installation

### Composer

```bash
composer require "resendlabs/resend-php"
```
<!-- End SDK Installation -->

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being Bearer re_123456789 where re_123456789 is your API Key. First, you need to get an API key, which is available in the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/login).

```bash
Authorization: Bearer re_123
```

## SDK Example Usage
```php
<?php
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

use ResendLabs\ResendSDK\Resend;
use ResendLabs\ResendSDK\Models\Shared\Security;
use ResendLabs\ResendSDK\Models\Shared\SchemeBearerAuth;
use ResendLabs\ResendSDK\Models\Operations\SendEmailRequest;

$security = new Security();
$security->bearerAuth = new SchemeBearerAuth();
$security->bearerAuth->authorization = "Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE";

$sdk = Resend::builder()
    ->setSecurity($security)
    ->build();

$request = new SendEmailRequest();
$request->from = "hello@resend.com"
$request->to = "thefuture@yourcompany.com"
$request->subject = "Welcome to Resend!"
$request->text = "Hello, World!"

$response = $sdk->email->sendEmail($request);

if ($response->statusCode === 200) {
    echo "Email sent successfully!";
} else {
